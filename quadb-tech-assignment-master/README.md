# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# QuadB Tech Internship Test

## Guidelines:

Please follow the following pointers while doing the assignment:

1. Assignment duration: 1 day(we expect the assignment in full)
2. Attach a Readme to your code
3. Use react router for routing
4. Use redux for state management
5. UI and functionality :

   - Add login/signup to your portal with minimal but relevant login details
   - Use localstorage/sessionstorage to maintain the session for a logged in user

   - Create a landing page with a single input asking the user what programming language theyâ€™re looking for a job in.
   - Once the user chooses a language, make a request to the Github public API searching for jobs that require developers who know said language.
   - Show the user a list of jobs with an option to view them in detail.
   - Once the user selects a job posting, make another request to the API to fetch that particular job.
   - Add another page to view that particular job and provide an option to apply.
   - Upon clicking apply, show the user a form asking them for the following:

     - Name
     - Email
     - Cover Letter Note
     - A file upload for resume, cover letter etc would be a plus

   - When the user submits the form, show them a success page with a preview of what their application looks like.
   - There is no API request involved in showing the success page, you just have to transfer the data within the app. Use state management for this.
   - The design of the page, validations, rules etc are left up to you but we expect all in place

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
